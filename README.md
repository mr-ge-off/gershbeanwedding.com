## why

As college interns, Aaron asked Kaley out on a date.

Aaron's credit card was declined, and Kaley had to pay.

Kaley said, hey, it's alright, because Kaley was making more money than Aaron per hour as part of the _same internship_.

## and how

Here are some helpful details about the wedding weekend.
